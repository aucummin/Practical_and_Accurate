not mentioned here, we strongly encourage you to inform the author

Old problems that were fixed:
----------------------------

Underflow messages with SIBYLL. The new SIBYLL 1.6 seems to work more
                                smoothly not producing all the error
                                messages generated by the previos one (1.5).

Kaon primaries. Kaons are now supported by AIRES, even as primary particles.
