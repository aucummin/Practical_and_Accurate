# As you see, all characters following '#' are ignored, as well as blank lines.

# Every AIRES input file is a set of directives. All directives must be placed
# in a single line, which can have up to 176 characters.

Remark    PRIMARY PARTICLE EMERGES FROM GROUND.

# The directives can be placed in any order.
# The input directives define a "task". Tasks are identified by their
# task name and (eventually) version. If not defined, the version is zero.

# The primary is defined by means of a "special primary" directive.

# Zenith angle. In an inverted shower the zenith angle is the angle
# of the emerging shower axis, equal to pi - primary_angle.
# For example for a primary angle of 96 deg we have:

PrimaryZenAngle  84 deg

# You can freely set the number of observing levels to record the shower
# longitudinal development. You can define up to 510 observing levels and
# (optionally) altitude of the highest and lowest levels.
