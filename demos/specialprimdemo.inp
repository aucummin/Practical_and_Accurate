# File specialprimdemo.inp: A first example on how to use the "special"
#                           primary particles feature of AIRES (Since
#                           version 2.2.0).
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# As you see, all characters following '#' are ignored, as well as blank lines.

# Every AIRES input file is a set of directives. All directives must be placed
# in a single line, which can have up to 176 characters.

# This file is similar to "demo1.inp", but it uses the "special" primary
# feature.

Skip &next

The directive "Skip" skips all text until the label &label is found. Notice
that it is not equivalent to a "go to" statement since it is not possible to
skip backwards.
This statement is useful to introduce plain text in the input files (with no
need of single line comment '#' characters), as well to skip a part of the
directives without deleting the lines.

&next


# Remarks will appear in the summary file. The "Remark" directive can be
# abbreviated and has two alternative forms:

Remark    EXAMPLE WITH SPECIAL PRIMARIES     # 1.- Single-line remarks.

Rem &eor                                     # 2.- Multi-line remarks.

This is an example of an input file for AIRES.
There are many things to learn here.
&eor
# You can place as many remarks as you want.

# The directives can be placed in any order.
# The input directives define a "task". Tasks are identified by their
# task name and (eventually) version. If not defined, the version is zero.

Task demospp  # Use "Task demospp 5" to explicitly set task version to 5.

# The first argument of the preceding directive is the name given to the
# special particle being defined (up to 16 characters). The second field
# is an executable module which will be invoked by the simulation program
# at the beginning of every showers. This module must generate the
# actual primary particle(s) to insert in the stacks before going on with
# the propagation of the shower.

# In this example "specialprim0" refers to the executable program generated
# after compiling the file "specialprim0.f" (located inside this "demo"
# directory). It is the user's responsibility to have this program correctly
# compiled before processing this demo.

# It is possible to define up to 10 special particles for a given task.

# It is also possible to pass parameters to the executable progam,
# placing them in the AddSpecialParticle directive after the
# module's name. Additionally, it is possible to define global variables
# that are readable from within the executable module. Such global variables
# can be defined using the SetGlobal directive like in the following
# examples (see the documentation for details):

SetGlobal MYVAR1 String associated with this variable.
SetGlobal Static MYVAR2  0.001567

# The following directives are mandatory (have no default values)
# Look that TAB characters can also be used in place of blanks.
# The primary particle is a "special" one.

TotalShowers		3
PrimaryParticle		manyhadrons
PrimaryEnergy		1 PeV

# All other parameters will be assigned a default value if not set.
