# File demo1.inp: A first example of an AIRES input file.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# As you see, all characters following '#' are ignored, as well as blank lines.

# Every AIRES input file is a set of directives. All directives must be placed
# in a single line, which can have up to 176 characters.

Skip &next

The directive "Skip" skips all text until the label &label is found. Notice
that it is not equivalent to a "go to" statement since it is not possible to
skip backwards.
This statement is useful to introduce plain text in the input files (with no
need of single line comment '#' characters), as well to skip a part of the
directives without deleting the lines.

&next

# It is possible to define global variables, either to use them within the
# input file or to pass parameters to other analysis programs (the
# defined variables and their contents are stored within the relevant
# output files and can be retrieved by means of library routines).

SetGlobal Myenergy1  150 MeV

# Remarks will appear in the summary file. The "Remark" directive can be
# abbreviated and has two alternative forms:

Remark    A FIRST EXAMPLE             # 1.- Single-line remarks.

Rem &eor                              # 2.- Multi-line remarks.

This is a first example of an input file for AIRES.
There are many things to learn here.
&eor
# You can place as many remarks as you want.

# The directives can be placed in any order.
# The input directives define a "task". Tasks are identified by their
# task name and (eventually) version. If not defined, the version is zero.

Task demo1  # Use "Task demo1 5" to explicitly set task version to 5.

# The following directives are mandatory (have no default values)
# Look that TAB characters can also be used in place of blanks.

TotalShowers		3
PrimaryParticle		proton
PrimaryEnergy		350 TeV

# All other parameters will be assigned a default value if not set.

Ground     1000 g/cm2  # Most quantities are specified by two fields:
                       # "number" and "unit". In this case "unit" can be
                       # g/cm2, cm, m or km
#
# You can freely set the number of observing levels to record the shower
# longitudinal development. You can define up to 510 observing levels and
# (optionally) altitude of the highest and lowest levels.
