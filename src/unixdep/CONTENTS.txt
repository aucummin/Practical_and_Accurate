    AIRES distribution src/unixdep directory CONTENTS.txt file.

This directory contains some routines whose code may depend on the
operating system; for example: file name string processing routines and
procedures to write data files which will be processable by OS scripts.
The routines within "unixdep" directory account for the UNIX OS case.

All these sources are written in standard FORTRAN 77, using a few extensions
that are supported by all presently available compilers (to the best of our
knowledge, of course).

There are no user customizable files here. If you want to develop similar
routines to run under other operating systems, you should leave these
intact, make another directory (for example "vmsdep" for VMS), and
code new routines there. If you succeed in doing that for other non-unix
OS, or if you want to do that and have problems, please contact us via
electronic mail to sciutto@fisica.unlp.edu.ar.
