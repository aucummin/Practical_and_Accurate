    AIRES distribution src/netlib_minpack directory CONTENTS.txt file.

This directory contains the NETLIB implementation of the well-known
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for nonlinear least squares fitting
(package "lmder" of "minpack" within NETLIB).

NETLIB (Internet: http://www.netlib.org/) is a collection of mathematical
software, papers, and databases, most of them in the public domain.

The files within "netlib_minpack" directory are:

      dpmpar.f, enorm.f
      lmder.f, lmpar.f,
      qrfac.f, qrsolv.f       Non-linear least squares fitting routines.

      minpack.readme,
      lmder.f.tar.gz          "lmder" package original distribution.


The subroutines that make the lmder package are written in standard
FORTRAN 77.

There are no user customizable files here. If you have installation problems
it is unlikely that they are due to any of the procedures stored within this
directory. Anyway, if you find something wrong that involves one or more of
these files, we will very much acknowledge if you inform about the problem
via electronic mail to sciutto@fisica.unlp.edu.ar.
