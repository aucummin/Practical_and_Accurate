    AIRES distribution src/igrf directory CONTENTS.txt file.

This directory contains the routines to evaluate the geomagnetic field
at a given place (determined by geographical coordinates, altitude and
date). The model used is the International Geomagnetic Reference Field
(IGRF), described in www.ngdc.noaa.gov.

The files within "igrf" directory are:

      AiresCalls.f            Interface AIRES-IGRF10.

      AiresLibutils.f         Some additional routines for the AIRES library.

      igrf10syn.f             IGRF10 geomagnetic field syntesis routine.

      igrfpar.f               Parameters currently used.

      igrf10                  Directory containing the IGRF10 original
                              source code.

The subroutines that make the interface AIRES-IGRF are written in standard
FORTRAN 77, using a few extensions that are supported by all presently
available compilers (to the best of our knowledge, of course).

There are no user customizable files here. If you have installation problems
it is unlikely that they are due to any of the procedures stored within this
directory. Anyway, if you find something wrong that involves one or more of
these files, we will very much acknowledge if you inform about the problem
via electronic mail to sciutto@fisica.unlp.edu.ar. You may also
contact GEOMAG's authors (see inside directory geomag.unix).
