    AIRES distribution src/qgsjetII directory CONTENTS.txt file.

This directory contains the QGSJET-II (version qgsjet-II-03) hadronic
interactions model of S. S. Ostapchenko (see, S. S. Ostapchenko, 
Nucl. Phys. Proc. Suppl. B151 (2006) 143).


The files within "qgsjetII" directory are:

      AiresCalls.f            Interface AIRES-QGSJET-II.

      psran.f                 Link between AIRES random number generator and
                              the generator call used within QGSJET.

      qgsjet-II-03.f          QGSJET-II routines. These routines were taken
                              from the QGSJET file provided by the author.
                              A few minor modifications were performed. Such
                              modifications do not affect to any of the
                              physics routines.

      qgsjetII/               QGSJET-II original source code, as received
      qgsjet-II-03.f.gz       from S. Ostapchenko.


The subroutines that make the interface AIRES-QGSJET-II are written in
standard FORTRAN 77, using a few extensions that are supported by all
presently available compilers (to the best of our knowledge, of course).

There are no user customizable files here. If you have installation problems
it is unlikely that they are due to any of the procedures stored within this
directory. Anyway, if you find something wrong that involves one or more of
these files, we will very much acknowledge if you inform about the problem
via electronic mail to sciutto@fisica.unlp.edu.ar. You may also
contact QGSJET's authors (see inside qgsjet-II-03.f).
