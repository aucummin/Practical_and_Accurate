    AIRES distribution src/aires directory CONTENTS.txt file.

This directory contains the main programs and subroutines that make the
main body of AIRES.

All these sources are written in standard FORTRAN 77, using a few extensions
that are supported by all presently available compilers (to the best of our
knowledge, of course).

There are no user customizable files here. If you have installation problems
it is unlikely that they are due to any of the procedures stored within this
directory. Anyway, if you find something wrong that involves one or more of
these files, we will very much acknowledge if you inform about the problem
via electronic mail to sciutto@fisica.unlp.edu.ar.
