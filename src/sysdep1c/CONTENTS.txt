    AIRES distribution src/sysdep1c directory CONTENTS.txt file.

This directory contain routines which perform system dependent calls
(date, time, etc.). Some of their statements are non-standard FORTRAN 77.

"sysdep1c" contain the routines needed for compatiblity with old Linux
systems using gcc (C compiler) and f2c|gcc to compile FORTRAN code.

There are no user customizable files here. If you want to develop similar
routines to run under other systems, you should leave these intact, make
another directory (preferently named "sysdepN" with N a number), and
code new routines there. If you succeed in doing that for other platforms
and/or operating systems, or if you want to do that and have problems,
please contact us via electronic mail to sciutto@fisica.unlp.edu.ar.
