    AIRES distribution src/cinterface directory CONTENTS.txt file.

This directory contains some FORTRAN and C subroutines needed to use
the AIRES library from a C environment.

There are no user customizable files here. If you have installation problems
it is unlikely that they are due to any of the procedures stored within this
directory. Anyway, if you find something wrong that involves one or more of
these files, we will very much acknowledge if you inform about the problem
via electronic mail to sciutto@fisica.unlp.edu.ar.
