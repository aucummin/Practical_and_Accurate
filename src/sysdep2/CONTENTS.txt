    AIRES distribution src/sysdep2 directory CONTENTS.txt file.

This directory contain routines which perform system dependent calls
(date, time, etc.). Some of their statements are non-standard FORTRAN 77.

"sysdep2" contain the routines that are compatible with SUN FORTRAN,
          HP FORTRAN and (sometimes) IBM FORTRAN.

There are no user customizable files here. If you want to develop similar
routines to run under other systems, you should leave these intact, make
another directory (preferently named "sysdepN" with N a number), and
code new routines there. If you succeed in doing that for other platforms
and/or operating systems, or if you want to do that and have problems,
please contact us via electronic mail to sciutto@fisica.unlp.edu.ar.
