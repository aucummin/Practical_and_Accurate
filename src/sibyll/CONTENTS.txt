    AIRES distribution src/sibyll directory CONTENTS.txt file.

This directory contains the SIBYLL hadronic interactions model of Fletcher,
Gaisser, Lipari and Stanev (see, R. Engel, T. K. Gaisser, T. Stanev, "Air
Shower Calculations With the New Version of SIBYLL", proc. of the 26th ICRC,
Utah 1999, vol. 1, p. 415).

The files within "sibyll" directory are:

      AiresCalls.f            Interface AIRES-SIBYLL.

      sibyll_21.f             SIBYLL 2.1 routines. Some minor modifications
      nuclib_21.f             were performed to adapt the package to the
                              AIRES framework.

      linkutils.f             Some auxiliary routines needed for the
                              interface with AIRES.

      sibyll_2-1              Directory containing the original source code,
                              as delivered by its authors.


The subroutines that make the interface AIRES-SIBYLL are written in standard
FORTRAN 77, using a few extensions that are supported by all presently
available compilers (to the best of our knowledge, of course).

There are no user customizable files here. If you have installation problems
it is unlikely that they are due to any of the procedures stored within this
directory. Anyway, if you find something wrong that involves one or more of
these files, we will very much acknowledge if you inform about the problem
via electronic mail to sciutto@fisica.unlp.edu.ar. You may also contact
SIBYLL's authors (see inside SIBYLL source code).
