    AIRES distribution src/qgsjet directory CONTENTS.txt file.

This directory contains the QGSJET 01c (version 2001.3) hadronic
interactions model of N. N. Kalmykov and S. S. Ostapchenko
(see, N. N. Kalmykov, S. S. Ostapchenko, A. I. Pavlov,
 Nucl. Phys. B (Proc. Suppl.) 52B (1997) 17).


The files within "qgsjet" directory are:

      AiresCalls.f            Interface AIRES-QGSJET01.

      psran.f                 Link between AIRES random number generator and
                              the generator call used within QGSJET.

      qgsjet01c.f             QGSJET01 routines. These routines were taken
                              from the QGSJET file that comes with the CORSIKA
                              air shower simulation program. A few minor
                              modifications were performed.

      qgsjet/qgsjet01c.f.gz   QGSJET01 original source code, as distributed
                              with CORSIKA (this package contains some
                              modifications done by D. Heck, Ik3 Fzk Karlsruhe,
                              Germany).


The subroutines that make the interface AIRES-QGSJET01c are written in standard
FORTRAN 77, using a few extensions that are supported by all presently
available compilers (to the best of our knowledge, of course).

There are no user customizable files here. If you have installation problems
it is unlikely that they are due to any of the procedures stored within this
directory. Anyway, if you find something wrong that involves one or more of
these files, we will very much acknowledge if you inform about the problem
via electronic mail to sciutto@fisica.unlp.edu.ar. You may also
contact QGSJET's authors (see inside qgsjet01c.f).
